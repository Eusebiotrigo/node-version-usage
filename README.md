## Suggested Compatible Format

Very few of the supporting products specify what they expect the file to contain, and I expect most just read it and process it as normal for _their_ version support. I would like to fill out the details on which products support which features, but for now here is an educated guess based on what I have seen.

- single line
- three part numeric version e.g. 14.5.0
- optional leading 'v' e.g. v14.5.0

So for example, this is likely to produce a widely compatible file (`sh`):

```
node --version > .node-version
```
